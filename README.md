# Brain Tumour Detection using Deep Learning

A deep learning project for classifying brain MRI scans as **tumorous** or **non-tumorous** using transfer learning and fine-tuning on a **VGG19 convolutional neural network**. The project explores baseline feature extraction, progressive fine-tuning, and overfitting trade-offs, achieving up to **89.3% test accuracy**.

## üîç Overview

-   **Model architecture:** VGG19 (transfer learning + custom dense layers).
-   **Approach:** Started with frozen VGG19 as a feature extractor, then progressively unfroze layers for fine-tuning.
-   **Dataset:** Brain MRI images, binary classification (tumour vs. non-tumour).
-   **Key techniques:** Data augmentation, class balancing, progressive unfreezing, early stopping, checkpointing.
-   **Result:** Final fine-tuned model reached **89.3% accuracy** on test data.
